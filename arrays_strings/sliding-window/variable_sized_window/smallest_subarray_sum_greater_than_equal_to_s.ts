/**
 * Problem : Smallest Subarray with Sum Greater Than or Equal to S
 * Description: Given an array of positive integers nums and a positive integer s,
 * find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum is greater than or equal to s.
 * If there isn't one, return 0.
 *
 * Input: s = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
